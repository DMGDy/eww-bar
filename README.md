# my eww bar

## epic bar!
This uses ![eww][https://github.com/elkowar/eww] to recreate and enhance my experience with ![dwm][https://github.com/DMGDy/dwm].
Also because this runs well on ![hyprland][https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland].

## purpose

Besides the wifi widget, all widgets apart of the bar are written in C and Rust because of compiled binary performance.
Too often people are lazy and write scripts for something that can just as easily be done by a single binary program.
As to why the wifi widget is not a compiled binary instead of a Python script, im too lazy. Additionally it is very slow and plan to change it at some point

## uses
run `eww open bar`
